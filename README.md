- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kienitobo
- 👀 I became interested in building interactive web pages when I decided to build a website for my knitting business. Now I build simple interactive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.  
- 🌱 In my spare time I knit, crochet, read and research.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on React projects
